# Useful_Genomics_Scripts
Repository of utility scripts that I use frequently while working with genomic data

removeshortcontigs.py: removing contigs under 200 nucleotides for NCBI submission, written in python using biopython

chromosome_new_name_move.sh: rename contigs.fasta from output of SPAdes to include isolate name from a list in a text file and move to a new folder

quast.sh: running quast through a list of assemblies from a text file
